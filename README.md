## 🧠 Model Details  
### Model Type: Linear Regression  

### Description:  
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous outcomes based on one or more input features.  
- It models the relationship between the dependent variable (health parameter) and independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.  

### Equation:  
\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
\]  

### Applications in this project:  
- **Predicting trends** in vital signs like glucose levels or heart rate based on historical data.  
- **Generating insights** about potential health risks.
